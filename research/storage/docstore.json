This question reflects how the desire t o live in developed \nIndia has entered into the minds of the youth. The same feelings are  echoed by over \nfifteen lakh youth, whom I have met so far and who represent the drea m of the 540 \nmillion youth of the nation. The aspirations of the young to live in a prosperous, safe and \nproud India should be the guiding factor in whatever profession we contribute. \n \nEmpower Villages \nFriends, I recall my visit to Nagaland on 26th October 2002, soon after m y assuming \noffice as President. It was a unique experience for me at Khuza ma village to meet tribal \nvillage council members and discuss with them the village progress  and the dream of \nvillage citizens. I was very happy to see the empowered village  council functioning with \nfinancial powers and taking decisions. I saw a prosperous village with fruits and \nvegetables production. However, there is a need for providing physical c onnectivity in \nNagaland through quality roads for enabling faster movement of produ cts from villages \nto the market. That meeting gave me a powerful message about the t ransformation which \ncan take place to the 600,000 villages of India, if all the villages a re empowered to deal \nwith their development and are well connected among themselves and wit h the urban \nsocieties. \n \nMobilizing rural core competence for competitiveness \nNow I would like to talk about the initiative of Periyar Maniammai  College of \nTechnology for Women, Vallam, Tanjore of Providing Urban Amenities in Rural Areas \n(PURA) complex involving 65 villages with a population of 3 lakhs. This inc ludes \nprovision of three connectivities - physical, electronic and knowledge  - leading to \neconomic connectivity. Periyar PURA has health care centers, pr imary to post graduate \nlevel education and vocational training centers. This has resulted i n large-scale \nemployment generation and creation of number of entrepreneurs with the  active support \nof 1000 self-help groups. Two hundred acres of waste land has been develope d into a \ncultivable land. The villagers are busy in cultivation, planting Jatropha, herbal and \nmedicinal plants, power generation using bio-mass, food processing and above all \nrunning marketing centers. It provides a sustainable economic developm ent model for the \nwhole region. \n \nDuring the last eight months, people of Periyar PURA villages technologically supported \nby Periyar Maniammai College of Engineering for Women have w orked with experts \nfrom Japan External Trade Organisation (JETRO) on various products, for  which core \ncompetence and raw material are available in Thanjavur district. They developed \ninternationally competitive prototypes for 55 life style products wi th support of JETRO \nspecialists and feedback from exhibitions at Delhi and Tokyo. This co -operative venture \nhas enhanced the innovative ability of the people of all the 65 villages  enabling them to \ndevelop and produce internationally acceptable products. I have seen si milar type of \nPURA being established in many states.

Recently, during my address to the agricultural \nscientists while participating in a National Symposium on \u201cAgri culture Cannot Wait\u201d, I \nsummarized the many practical suggestions given by farmers. W e have to double the \nagricultural production with reduced land, reduced water resources and re duced \nmanpower and improve the economic conditions of the nation through the principle  of \n\u201cSeed to Food\u201d since agriculture is the backbone of the nation. We should em power the \nfarmers to protect and nurture the fertile land for second green re volution. Meeting the \nScientists and the Farmers has given me the confidence \nthat the nation is poised to increase the agricultural GDP growth by atleast 4% per annum \nthrough the partnership of farmers and agricultural scientists a nd industries particularly \nfor value addition. \n \nDefeat the problems and succeed \nOn the evening of February 24, 2007, at Coimbatore, I had a very beautif ul experience. \nAs I got ready for meeting the first person out of twenty appoint ments, a wheel chair was \nin sight with a smiling person probably in his late fifties; unfortunately he has no hands \nand legs. His radiant face was revealing his happy state of mi nd. He introduced himself \nas Vidwan Coimbatore SR Krishna Murthy. I greeted him and asked him  how this had \nhappened. He smilingly said that it was from by birth. He thanked G od, his parents, \nteachers and many others for giving him confidence, training and he lp. I asked him, what \nI could do for him? He said, \u201cI don\u2019t need anything from you. I would like to sing in fr ont \nof you\u201d. I readily agreed. He sang melodiously the Saint Thyagraj a\u2019s pancha ratna kriti \nentharo mahanubavulu in Sriragam giving me a glimpse of his talent. I was quite  touched. \nWhat is the message? Despite being physically challenged, the latent talent of music \ncould blossom in this \nperson with his positive attitude and perseverance, encouraged by the pa rents, teachers, \nacademics and rasikas. Now he wants to give, give and give his art to inspire others. Of \ncourse, by his merit of music, in July 2007, he performed in the Rashtra pati Bhavan art \ntheatre. \n \nOvercome the impact of disaster through partnership \nI had the opportunity to experience the Indomitable Spirit of the people  and children of \nJammu & Kashmir even as they were just recovering from the de vastating earthquake in \n2005. I visited Urusa village on 26th November 2005 which has been adopted by the  \nWestern Air Command, Air Force for providing relief and medical aid to the residents of \nthat area. When I went there, I found that the school building had been severely  damaged. \nI met all the school children and the village citizen of Urusa. T he villagers apprised me of \ntheir losses and had all praise for Army and Air Force role in rescue and relief operations \nalong with state government. I appreciate the courage of the people of Urusa in defeating \ntheir problems. They have actually become the master of the probl em rather than \nallowing problems to become their master.

While various reconstruction a nd rehabilitation \nactivities were in progress, during the discussions with the members  of tribal council, I \nrealized the unique trait among the Car-Nicobar islanders.
